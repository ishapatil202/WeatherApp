# WeatherApp â€“ Kotlin-Based Functional Weather Forecast App

A Kotlin Android app that delivers real-time weather data using Jetpack Compose and Retrofit, applying functional programming principles and modern UI architecture.

---

## App Summary

**WeatherApp** allows users to:
- Search for any city and get up-to-date weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.)
- View recent search history and revisit previously searched cities
- Receive clothing suggestions based on the temperature ("What to Wear Today")
- Navigate between Home, Details, Search History, and About screens

The app is structured using **MVVM** architecture and written entirely in **Kotlin** using **Jetpack Compose** for UI.
